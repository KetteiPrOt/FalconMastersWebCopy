# FalconMasters Web Copy
I did this copy of FalconMasters main web site for practice responsive web layout with HTML and CSS.

This is only a responsive layout, you can visit the real web site [here](https://www.falconmasters.com/).

By the way, FalconMasters taught me how to layout responsive websites with HTML and CSS, in his web design course.
